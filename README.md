# Explore and Summarise Data with R
This project involves selecting a dataset and through the use of R use techniques to explore, analyse and interpret the data. For this project I selected the Financial Contributions made to Presedential Candidates in New York.

- FinancialContributions.html - the html version of the report
- P00000001-NY.txt - the dataset used in the report
- getCities.py - Python script used to clean up and produce a csv file containing a list of cities in New York along with their longitude and latitude.
- cities.csv - th csv file produce by the getCities.py script
